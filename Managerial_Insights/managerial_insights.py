    1. **Shipping Method Optimization:** Optimize shipping based on product type and quantity, not just product value. Air may be best for high-value, lightweight items, while heavier goods should use sea or land shipping for cost efficiency.
    2. **Supplier and Customer Relations:** Strengthen relationships with top suppliers (e.g., Johnson PLC) to negotiate better pricing and shipping terms. Focus on loyal customers by offering them favorable deals.
    3. **Shipping Cost Management:** Leverage volume-based discounts for shipments in the 2000â€“4000 weight range. Streamline packaging to minimize unnecessary weight and reduce costs.
    4. **Trade Strategy:** Focus export efforts on countries like Madagascar and Kiribati, and import strategies on Jamaica and Congo, to maximize trade value and growth.
    5. **Balanced Payment Terms:** Since all payment methods are equally preferred, consider offering incentives for early payments to optimize cash flow.
    6. **Product-Specific Strategies:** Tailor strategies for top-exported products (e.g., "Bad," "Church") and top-imported products (e.g., "Clear," "Change") to maximize trade opportunities.
    7. **Shipping Cost Efficiency:** Avoid assuming high-value goods require expensive shipping. Optimize shipping based on weight and destination for better cost management.
    8. **Transaction Optimization:** Encourage larger transactions through discounts or minimum thresholds to reduce the costs of processing small orders.
    9. **Trade Balance Focus:** Target countries with positive trade balances for export growth. Use competitive shipping and pricing strategies to increase market share.
    10. **Pricing Review:** Ensure shipping costs are factored into product pricing, especially for bulky or high-weight items, to maintain profitability.
